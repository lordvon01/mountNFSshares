To be used for mounting NFS shares.
Rename to whatever name you want it to be called (I.E. mountNFSshares.sh).
Copy to a local folder (I used /scripts in my environment).
Run sudo chmod +x nameofscript.sh to enable of the script.
Run bash -n to validate no errors when running the command.
Run with sudo permissions on the system.
